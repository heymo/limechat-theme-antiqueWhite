AntiqueWhite for LimeChat
===============================

A antique white theme for the IRC client _LimeChat_, for those who want something different than a dark theme...

To install it, either clone the repository into the LimeChat theme folder, copy the `*.css` and `*.yaml` files to the LimeChat themes folder, or create a symbolic link to it.

The LimeChat themes are located here:

`/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes/`

...or, if you got your LimeChat from the Apple store:

`/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/net.limechat.LimeChat-AppStore/Themes`
